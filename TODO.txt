TODO:
[] Stop Short Path Algorithm when destination is reached. Right now it computes incantations to 
all realms. Source to all destination

[] Store pathway from source to destination from from Short Path Algorithm

[] Implement Heap to Lower Time Complexity of Short Path Algorithm

[] Modify find max subsequence function to actually return the subsequence

[X] Use hash map for string lookup pointer retrieval. Reduces lookup from 
   O(n) to constant time
