TODO:
[X] Stop Short Path Algorithm when destination is reached. Right now it computes incantations to 
all realms. Source to all destination

[X] Store pathway from source to destination from from Short Path Algorithm

[] Implement Heap to Lower Time Complexity of Short Path Algorithm

[X] Modify find max subsequence function to actually return the subsequence

[X] Use hash map for string lookup pointer retrieval. Reduces lookup from 
   O(n) to constant time
